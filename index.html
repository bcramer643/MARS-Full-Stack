    <h1>The Olympic Games</h1>

    <p id="para1"> The ancient Olympic Games began in the year 776 BC, when Koroibos, a cook from the nearby city of
      Elis, won the stadion race, a foot race 600 feet long.
      The stadion track at Olympia is shown here. According to some literary traditions, this was the only athletic
      event of the games for the first 13 Olympic festivals or until 724 BC.
      From 776 BC, the Games were held in Olympia every four years for almost 12 centuries.
      Contrary evidence, both literary and archaeological, suggests that the games may have existed at Olympia much
      earlier than this date, perhaps as early as the 10th or 9th century BC.
    </p>

    <p> Although the ancient Games were staged in Olympia, Greece, from 776 BC through 393 AD, it took 1503 years for
      the Olympics to return.
      The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.
      The man responsible for its rebirth was a Frenchman named Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who presented the idea in
      1894.
      His original thought was to unveil the modern Games in 1900 in his native Paris, but delegates from 34 countries
      were so enthralled with the concept that they convinced him to move the Games up to 1896 and have Athens serve as
      the first host.
    </p>

    <p> The marathon was NOT an event of the ancient Olympic games.
      The marathon is a modern event that was first introduced in the Modern Olympic Games of 1896 in Athens,
      a race from Marathon northeast of Athens to the Olympic Stadium, a distance of 40 kilometers.
      The race commemorates the run of Pheidippides, an ancient "day-runner" who carried the news of the Persian landing
      at Marathon of 490 B.C. to Sparta (a distance of 149 miles)
      in order to enlist help for the battle. According to the fifth century B.C.ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
      Pheidippides delivered the news to the Spartans the next day.
      The distance of the modern marathon was standardized as 26 miles 385 yards or 42.195 km. in 1908 when the Olympic
      Games were held in London. The distance was the exact measurement between Windsor Castle, the start of the race,
      and the finish line inside White City Stadium.
